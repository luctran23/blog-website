# Simple Dinners Are the Best

## Introduction

After a long day, I had no idea what to eat. I stood there for a while, just staring into the kitchen like something would magically appear.

In the end, I kept it simple — I boiled some pork and added a few carrots. Nothing fancy, but it was warm, hearty, and exactly what I needed. Sometimes, it’s not about making something exciting — it’s just about making something that fills you up and feels good.

It reminded me that even the simplest meals can hit the spot when you’re tired. 🤣

I passed by the street where my old workplace is located.
