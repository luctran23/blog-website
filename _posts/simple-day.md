# A very simple day in my life

## Introduction

Today, I went to work at 8:00am. I did a long breath in lots of smoke from vehicles.
I was so high after that. 🤣

I was back to a street where my former workplace located.

*There's many tech company here*

I went through a intersection and see the highest building of this city.

*why is it so high like that?*

I went home and decide to cook dinner
Tofu with tomato sauce, some boiled green beans, and two poached eggs (I forget to put that in the video😭). That’s it!

I also made a short video about it. Nothing fancy, just a little glimpse into what I eat.
Please enjoy! 🎥🍴
