# A very simple day in my life

## Introduction

Today, I went to work at 8:00 AM.
Took a deep breath… full of vehicle smoke.
Felt weirdly high after that. 🤣

I passed by the street where my old workplace is located.

So many tech companies around here.

Then I walked through an intersection and saw the tallest building in the city.

Why is it that tall though?

I came home and decided to cook dinner.
Just two dishes today: chả lá lốt and boiled spinach.
Simple, but I ended up eating four bowls of rice. 😅

That’s it!

I also made a short video about it. Nothing fancy, just a little glimpse into what I eat.
Please enjoy! 🎥🍴
