# Websquare introduction
Let's dig deeper to know what Websquare is. Basically, it is a tool that helps software engineer build a website easier. In this article, I'm going to focus on Websquare5.

WebSquare5 consists of the Engine and the WebSquare5 Studio (development tool). The Engine receives requests from the browser and displays the WebSquare5 XML files on the browser in an HTML-compatible manner. The developer can create web UI on the WebSquare5 Studio.
