# A very simple meal in my life

## Introduction

I don't know about you, but my dinners are always simple — mainly because I'm lazy 😅
Also, I really don't want to get fat.

Tonight's dinner?
Tofu with tomato sauce, some boiled green beans, and two poached eggs (I forget to put that in the video😭). That’s it!

I also made a short video about it. Nothing fancy, just a little glimpse into what I eat.
Please enjoy! 🎥🍴
